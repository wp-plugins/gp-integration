Integrates GlotPress with your WordPress installation.

== Description ==

GlotPress is a great way to manage and work collaborative on translations for your projects and with GP Integration it becomes even better!

GP Integration adds the missing features you need to run GlotPress effectivly:

	* Manage admin users
	* Add and delete and reset passwords for users in the local GlotPress user table
	* Delete projects and translation sets
	* View your GlotPress site right in the WordPress Admin interface
	* Shortcode to embed your GlotPress installation right in to your WordPress front end
	* Support for both integrated (your using the WordPress database) and standalone (your using another database on the same server)

This code is released under the GPL v2, see license.txt for details.

1. Extract the archive file into your plugins directory in the gp-integration folder.
2. Activate the plugin in the Plugin options.
3. To to the GlotPress->Settings menu.
4. Configure your database name (leave blank to use your WordPress database).
5. Configure your table prefix (by default "gp_" is used).
6. Configure the path to GlotPress (fully qualified is best).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't have GlotPress installed, can I still use GP Integration? =

No, you have to have a copy of GlotPress installed for GP Integration to be useful.  A future plugin will be released that includes a full copy of GlotPress setup and configured to run as part of the plugin, but that is still in development.

= In your screen shots your GlotPress logo background matches the background of the WordPress admin area, how did you do that? =

The GlotPress logo is a PNG, but it doesn't have a transparent background set.  You can find it in your GlotPress install under "img/glotpress-logo.png", use your faviorite image editor and remove the background with the magic wand!

= What is the shortcode name? =

[gp-integration]

= How does the shortcode work? =

The shortcode creats an iFrame along with a bit of JavaScript.  The JavaScript will resize the iFrame to match the height of the GlotPress page being displayed.  The JavaScript fires once a second so you may see a slight delay in the iFrame being resized.

Also note that external links the "Proudly powered by GlotPress" in the footer, if clicked, will break the resizing script.
